			<h1 class="headers">Who is Nokotan?</h1>
			<p>Nokotan is a character from the anime <b><i>"My Deer Friend Nokotan."</i></b> The first episode aired July 3, 2024 and is produced by Wit Studio. </p>

			<p>One of these characters are <i>Nokotan</i> (Noko Shikanoko), my personal favorite! She is an... Odd character, we could say the least. Some of her quirks are things like: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Obsession with deer crackers</li>
				<li>Constant happiness (Although, she can show emotions like anger and sadness)</li>
				<li>Likes shortening names (Shortening Torako Koshi's name to "Koshitan" and her own name to "Nokotan")</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Nokotan's obsession with deer crackers borders on broderline <b>insane</b>. She goes to such great lengths to where in something like (For example) Season 1 Episode 2, Nokotan sees a deer cracker, but it's very obviously. </p>

			<p>Another thing that should be known about Nokotan is that she's <i>extremely</i> naive and childlike. If you tell her something, there's a high chance she'll belive you. This makes sense context wise due to it being a comedy anime, and it really doesn't take itself seriously most of the time.</p>

			<p>Even though it makes absolutely no sense that a deer/human hybrid that can basically bend the laws of physics and life to exist, most of the characters in the series don't mind.</p>
